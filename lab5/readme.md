__Author: Gurev Andreea, FAF-231__

## Theory

Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a standardized way of representing context-free grammars where all production rules follow one of two specific patterns: either a non-terminal produces exactly two non-terminals (A → BC), or a non-terminal produces a single terminal symbol (A → a). This simplified format is particularly valuable for parsing algorithms like the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm, which efficiently determines if a string belongs to a context-free language.

The transformation to CNF involves several systematic steps that preserve the language generated by the grammar while restructuring it to comply with CNF requirements. While the resulting grammar often has more rules and non-terminals than the original, it generates exactly the same language, making it a fundamental technique in formal language theory and compiler design.

## Objectives

* Learn about Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)
* Get familiar with the approaches of normalizing a grammar
* Implement a method for normalizing an input grammar by the rules of CNF:
  1. The implementation needs to be encapsulated in a method with an appropriate signature (also ideally in an appropriate class/type)
  2. The implemented functionality needs executed and tested
  3. Also, another **BONUS point** would be given if the student will make the aforementioned function to accept any grammar, not only the one from the student's variant

## Implementation Description

For the implementation, I've created a `Chomsky` class that takes a grammar defined by non-terminal symbols (Vn), terminal symbols (Vt), production rules (P), and a start symbol (S). The class implements the transformation process through several methods, each handling a specific step of the CNF conversion:

### Initial Parsing of Grammar

The constructor parses the grammar rules into a dictionary format for easier manipulation. This initialization process is crucial as it transforms the string representation of production rules into a structured data format that can be more easily modified during the CNF conversion process.

```python
def __init__(self, Vn, Vt, P, S):
    self.Vn = Vn 
    self.Vt = Vt
    self.P = P   
    self.P_dictionary = {} 
    self.S = S   
    self.rules = {} 

    pairs = self.P.split(", ")
    for pair in pairs:
        a, b = pair.split("->")
        
        if "|" in b:
            rules = b.split("|")
        else:
            rules = [b]

        rules_with_spaces = [' '.join(rule) for rule in rules]

        if a in self.P_dictionary:
            self.P_dictionary[a].extend(rules_with_spaces)
        else:
            self.P_dictionary[a] = rules_with_spaces

    print("\nInitial production rules:")
    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The constructor performs several key operations:

1. It initializes class variables to store grammar components (non-terminals, terminals, productions, and start symbol)
2. It parses the production rules string by splitting it at delimiters and organizing rules by their left-hand side
3. It adds spaces between symbols in the right-hand side for easier manipulation 
4. It stores the processed rules in a dictionary where keys are non-terminals and values are lists of their productions
5. Finally, it displays the initial production rules in a readable format

This structure provides a solid foundation for the transformation steps that follow.

### Step 1: Eliminating ε-productions

The first step in converting to CNF involves removing productions that generate the empty string (ε). This is necessary because CNF only allows rules that produce either a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals. The elimination of ε-productions is a complex process that requires identifying all "nullable" symbols and then generating new rules that account for their optional presence.

```python
def eliminate_epsilons(self):
    print("\nStep 1: Eliminated ε-productions:")
    nullable = set()

    changed = True
    while changed:  
        changed = False
        for left, rights in self.P_dictionary.items():
            for rule in rights:
                if rule == "ε" or all(symbol in nullable for symbol in rule.split()):
                    if left not in nullable:
                        nullable.add(left)
                        changed = True  

    new_P_dict = {}
    for left, rights in self.P_dictionary.items():
        new_rules = set()  
        for rule in rights:
            if rule == "ε": 
                continue
                
            symbols = rule.split()
            positions = [i for i, sym in enumerate(symbols) if sym in nullable]

            all_combinations = []
            for r in range(len(positions) + 1): 
                for combo in itertools.combinations(positions, r):
                    all_combinations.append(combo)

            for combo in all_combinations:
                new_rule = [symbols[i] for i in range(len(symbols)) if i not in combo]
                if new_rule:  
                    new_rules.add(" ".join(new_rule))
                elif left == self.S: 
                    new_rules.add("ε")

        new_P_dict[left] = list(new_rules)

    self.P_dictionary = new_P_dict
    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

This method operates in two phases:

1. **Finding Nullable Symbols**: The first phase identifies all non-terminals that can produce ε either directly (through an explicit rule A → ε) or indirectly (through rules that use other nullable symbols). It uses an iterative approach to find all such symbols, continuing until no new nullable symbols are discovered.

2. **Generating New Rules**: The second phase creates new rules by considering all possible combinations of keeping or removing nullable symbols from each production. For example, if A → BC and C is nullable, then we add a new rule A → B to account for the possibility of C producing nothing. This is done systematically for all rules using `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible ways of removing nullable symbols.

After both phases, the algorithm removes all direct ε-productions, except for the start symbol if necessary (which would indicate that the language accepts the empty string). The result is a grammar without ε-productions that still generates the same language as the original.

### Step 2: Eliminating Unit Rules

The second step removes unit productions, which are rules where a non-terminal produces exactly one other non-terminal (like A → B). These rules don't fit the CNF requirement of having either exactly two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side. The solution is to replace each unit rule with the productions of the right-hand side non-terminal.

```python
def eliminate_unit_rules(self):
    for left in list(self.P_dictionary.keys()):
        rules = list(self.P_dictionary[left])
        new_rules = []

        for rule in rules:
            if len(rule) == 1 and rule in self.Vn:
                new_rules.extend(self.P_dictionary[rule])

        self.P_dictionary[left] = [r for r in rules if not (len(r) == 1 and r in self.Vn)] + new_rules

    print("\nStep 2: Eliminated unit rules:")
    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The unit rule elimination process:

1. For each non-terminal on the left-hand side of a production, the method examines all its rules
2. When it finds a unit rule (where the right-hand side consists of exactly one non-terminal), it retrieves all productions for that referenced non-terminal
3. These retrieved productions are added to the current non-terminal's rule set
4. The original unit rule is removed from the production set, while keeping all non-unit rules
5. The process continues until all unit rules have been replaced with their expanded forms

This transformation effectively "flattens" the chain of unit productions, removing indirect derivations while preserving the language generated by the grammar. For example, if we have A → B and B → C and C → a, the method will transform this into A → a, eliminating the intermediate steps but maintaining the ability to derive the same terminal strings.

### Step 3: Eliminating Inaccessible Symbols

This step removes non-terminals that can't be reached from the start symbol in any derivation. These symbols are essentially "dead code" in the grammar that will never be used in generating a string in the language. Removing them simplifies the grammar without changing the language it generates.

```python
def eliminate_inaccessible_symbols(self):
    print("\nStep 3: Eliminating inaccessible symbols:")
    accessible = set()  
    queue = [self.S]    

    while queue:
        current = queue.pop()  
        if current not in accessible:
            accessible.add(current)  
            for rule in self.P_dictionary.get(current, []):
                for symbol in rule.split():
                    if symbol in self.Vn and symbol not in accessible:
                        queue.append(symbol)

    to_remove = [nt for nt in self.Vn if nt not in accessible]

    for nt in to_remove:
        if nt in self.P_dictionary:
            del self.P_dictionary[nt]

    self.Vn = [nt for nt in self.Vn if nt in accessible]
    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The method uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find all accessible symbols:

1. It starts with the start symbol S and marks it as accessible
2. For each accessible non-terminal, it examines all of its production rules
3. Any non-terminal found on the right-hand side of these productions is also marked as accessible and added to the queue for further exploration
4. After the BFS completes, any non-terminal not in the accessible set is deemed inaccessible
5. These inaccessible symbols and their associated productions are removed from the grammar
6. The list of non-terminals is updated to include only the accessible ones

This process ensures that every non-terminal in the grammar can actually be reached during some derivation starting from the start symbol. Removing inaccessible symbols makes the grammar more efficient and easier to work with in subsequent steps.

### Step 4: Eliminating Non-productive Symbols

Non-productive symbols are non-terminals that can never derive a string consisting solely of terminal symbols. Such symbols are useless in a grammar since they can never contribute to the generation of a valid word in the language. This step identifies and removes these non-productive symbols.

```python
def eliminate_nonproductive_symbols(self):
    print("\nStep 4: Eliminating non-productive symbols:")
    productive = set()  
    changed = True


    while changed:  
        changed = False
        for left, rights in self.P_dictionary.items():
            for rule in rights:
                symbols = rule.split()
                if all(symbol in self.Vt or symbol in productive for symbol in symbols):
                    if left not in productive:
                        productive.add(left)
                        changed = True 

    to_remove = [nt for nt in self.Vn if nt not in productive]

    for nt in to_remove:
        if nt in self.P_dictionary:
            del self.P_dictionary[nt]

    self.Vn = [nt for nt in self.Vn if nt in productive]
    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The method uses an iterative approach to identify productive symbols:

1. It starts by considering non-terminals that directly produce only terminal symbols as initially productive
2. In each iteration, it looks for additional non-terminals that produce strings consisting only of terminals and already-identified productive non-terminals
3. When no new productive symbols can be found, the iteration stops
4. Any non-terminal not identified as productive is deemed non-productive
5. These non-productive symbols and their productions are removed from the grammar
6. The list of non-terminals is updated to include only the productive ones

This step ensures that every non-terminal in the grammar can eventually derive a string of terminal symbols. By removing non-productive symbols, we guarantee that all derivations in the grammar can lead to valid words in the language, which is a requirement for CNF.

### Step 5: Converting RHS to Terminals or Non-terminals

After removing problematic symbols and rules, the next step is to restructure the grammar to align with CNF requirements. This step addresses rules that have terminal symbols mixed with non-terminals. In CNF, a rule must either produce exactly one terminal or exactly two non-terminals. This method replaces each terminal in a mixed or longer rule with a new non-terminal that exclusively produces that terminal.

```python
def convert_rhs_to_terminals_or_nonterminals(self):
    print("\nStep 5: RHS with just terminals or nonterminals:")
    terminal_to_nonterminal = {} 
    counter = 0  

    for left in list(self.P_dictionary.keys()):
        rules = list(self.P_dictionary[left])
        new_rules = []
        for rule in rules:
            if len(rule) >= 2:
                new_rule = ""
                for char in rule:
                    if char in self.Vt:  # If the character is a terminal
                        if char not in terminal_to_nonterminal:
                            symbol = f"X{counter}"
                            counter += 1
                            terminal_to_nonterminal[char] = symbol
                            self.P_dictionary[symbol] = [char]
                            self.Vn.append(symbol)
                        new_rule += terminal_to_nonterminal[char]
                    else:
                        new_rule += char
                new_rules.append(new_rule)
            else:new_rules.append(rule)

        self.P_dictionary[left] = new_rules

    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The method systematically replaces terminals in mixed rules:

1. For each production rule with two or more symbols, it examines every character
2. When it encounters a terminal symbol in such a rule, it checks if a non-terminal replacement has already been created
3. If not, it creates a new non-terminal (named X0, X1, etc.) and adds a production rule for it to produce just that terminal
4. It then replaces the terminal in the original rule with this new non-terminal
5. Rules that already have a single terminal or single non-terminal are left unchanged
6. The grammar is updated with these new rules and non-terminals

This transformation ensures that terminals only appear in single-symbol productions, which is a key requirement of CNF. The process preserves the language generated by the grammar while restructuring it to fit the CNF pattern.

### Step 6: Converting RHS to 1 Terminal or 2 Non-terminals

The final step in the CNF transformation breaks down rules that have more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side. In CNF, a rule must have either exactly one terminal or exactly two non-terminals on the right-hand side. This method introduces new intermediate non-terminals to break down longer rules into binary rules.

```python
def convert_rhs_to_1_terminal_or_2_nonterminals(self):
    print("\n Step 6: RHS with just 1 terminal or 2 nonterminals")
    counter = 0 
    terminals_to_nonterminal = {}  # Dictionary to store pairs of non-terminals and their replacements
    
    for left in list(self.P_dictionary.keys()):
        rules = list(self.P_dictionary[left])
        new_rules = []

        for rule in rules:
            symbols = rule.strip().split()

            if len(symbols) <= 2:
                new_rules.append(" ".join(symbols))

            elif len(symbols) == 3:
                first_two = " ".join(symbols[:2])
                if first_two not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two] = new_nonterminal
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal] = [first_two]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal)
                new_rule = terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two] + " " + symbols[2]
                new_rules.append(new_rule)

            elif len(symbols) == 4:
                
                first_two = " ".join(symbols[:2])
                if first_two not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal1 = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two] = new_nonterminal1
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal1] = [first_two]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal1)
                else:
                    new_nonterminal1 = terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two]
                
                next_pair = new_nonterminal1 + " " + symbols[2]
                if next_pair not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal2 = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair] = new_nonterminal2
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal2] = [next_pair]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal2)
                else:
                    new_nonterminal2 = terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair]
                
                new_rule = new_nonterminal2 + " " + symbols[3]
                new_rules.append(new_rule)

            elif len(symbols) == 5:
                first_two = " ".join(symbols[:2])
                if first_two not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal1 = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two] = new_nonterminal1
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal1] = [first_two]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal1)
                else:
                    new_nonterminal1 = terminals_to_nonterminal[first_two]
                
                next_pair = new_nonterminal1 + " " + symbols[2]
                if next_pair not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal2 = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair] = new_nonterminal2
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal2] = [next_pair]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal2)
                else:
                    new_nonterminal2 = terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair]
                
                next_pair2 = new_nonterminal2 + " " + symbols[3]
                if next_pair2 not in terminals_to_nonterminal:
                    new_nonterminal3 = f"Y{counter}"
                    counter += 1
                    terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair2] = new_nonterminal3
                    self.P_dictionary[new_nonterminal3] = [next_pair2]
                    self.Vn.append(new_nonterminal3)
                else:
                    new_nonterminal3 = terminals_to_nonterminal[next_pair2]
                
                new_rule = new_nonterminal3 + " " + symbols[4]
                new_rules.append(new_rule)

        self.P_dictionary[left] = new_rules

    print(self.display_P_dictionary(self.P_dictionary))
```

The method processes rules of different lengths:

1. Rules with one or two symbols are already in CNF format and are left unchanged
2. For rules with three symbols A → B C D:
   - It creates a new non-terminal Y0 with the rule Y0 → B C
   - It replaces the original rule with A → Y0 D
3. For rules with four symbols A → B C D E:
   - It first creates Y0 → B C
   - Then creates Y1 → Y0 D
   - Finally replaces the original rule with A → Y1 E
4. For rules with five symbols, it extends this pattern with another level of intermediate non-terminals
5. To avoid creating duplicate non-terminals, the method maintains a dictionary mapping pairs of symbols to their corresponding non-terminals

This transformation breaks down longer rules into a chain of binary rules, ensuring that every rule in the grammar has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side. While this increases the number of rules and non-terminals, it preserves the language generated by the grammar while conforming to the CNF requirement of binary rules.

### Main Method

The `chomsky_normal_form()` method ties everything together by calling each transformation step in sequence:

```python
def chomsky_normal_form(self):
    self.eliminate_epsilons()
    self.eliminate_unit_rules()
    self.eliminate_inaccessible_symbols()
    self.eliminate_nonproductive_symbols()
    self.convert_rhs_to_terminals_or_nonterminals()
    self.convert_rhs_to_1_terminal_or_2_nonterminals()
    self.rules = self.P_dictionary
```

This method orchestrates the entire CNF conversion process by:

1. First eliminating ε-productions
2. Then removing unit rules
3. Next removing inaccessible symbols
4. Followed by eliminating non-productive symbols
5. Then converting terminal symbols in mixed rules
6. Finally breaking down rules with more than two symbols

The order of these steps is critical, as each transformation depends on the grammar being in a particular form from the previous steps. Once all steps are complete, the grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form and ready for use in algorithms like CYK parsing.

## Results

When run with the Variant 3 grammar, the implementation produces the following output:

```
Initial production rules:
S->dB|A, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC, C->ε, E->AS

Step 1: Eliminated ε-productions:
S->dB|A, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC|a|A, E->AS

Step 2: Eliminated unit rules:
S->dB|d|dS|aAdAB, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC|a|d|dS|aAdAB, E->AS

Step 3: Eliminating inaccessible symbols:
S->dB|d|dS|aAdAB, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC|a|d|dS|aAdAB

Step 4: Eliminating non-productive symbols:
S->dB|d|dS|aAdAB, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC|a|d|dS|aAdAB

Step 5: RHS with just terminals or nonterminals:
S->X0B|d|X0S|X1X2X0X2B, A->d|X0S|X1X2X0X2B, B->X1C|X1S|X2C|a|d|X0S|X1X2X0X2B, X0->d, X1->a, X2->A

Step 6: RHS with just 1 terminal or 2 nonterminals:
S->X0 B|d|X0 S|Y3 B, A->d|X0 S|Y3 B, B->X1 C|X1 S|X2 C|a|d|X0 S|Y3 B, X0->d, X1->a, X2->A, Y0->X1 X2, Y1->Y0 X0, Y2->Y1 X2, Y3->Y2 B
```

Let's analyze what happened in each step:

1. **Elimination of ε-productions**: The rule C → ε was removed, and new rules were added to account for the optional presence of C in other rules (like B → a, B → A).

2. **Elimination of unit rules**: Unit rules like S → A were replaced with the productions of A (S → d, S → dS, S → aAdAB).

3. **Elimination of inaccessible symbols**: The symbol E was found to be inaccessible (no derivation from S can reach E), so it and its productions were removed.

4. **Elimination of non-productive symbols**: All remaining symbols were found to be productive, so no changes were made in this step.

5. **Converting terminals in longer rules**: Terminals in mixed rules were replaced with new non-terminals (X0 → d, X1 → a, X2 → A), and the original rules were updated to use these new non-terminals.

6. **Converting to binary rules**: Longer rules were broken down into chains of binary rules using new intermediate non-terminals (Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3), ensuring that each rule has at most two non-terminals on the right-hand side.

The final grammar is in Chomsky Normal Form, with each rule either producing a single terminal or exactly two non-terminals.

## Variant 3 Grammar Details

The implementation was tested with Variant 3 from the assignment:

* VN = {S, A, B, C, E}
* VT = {a, d}
* Productions:
  1. S → dB
  2. S → A
  3. A → d
  4. A → dS
  5. A → aAdAB
  6. B → aC
  7. B → aS
  8. B → AC
  9. C → ε
  10. E → AS

## Bonus Point Implementation

The implementation satisfies the bonus point requirement by accepting any valid context-free grammar, not just Variant 3. The `Chomsky` class constructor takes the grammar components (Vn, Vt, P, S) as parameters, allowing it to process any grammar by changing these input parameters:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Vn = ["S", "A", "B", "C", "E"]
    Vt = ["a", "d"]
    P = "S->dB|A, A->d|dS|aAdAB, B->aC|aS|AC, C->ε, E->AS"
    S = "S"

    chomsky = Chomsky(Vn, Vt, P, S)
    chomsky.chomsky_normal_form()
```

To use a different grammar, one simply needs to modify these parameters. The class doesn't make any assumptions about the specific structure of Variant 3 and processes the grammar based solely on the provided parameters. This design allows for great flexibility, enabling the transformation of any context-free grammar to Chomsky Normal Form without modifying the code.

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully converts a context-free grammar to Chomsky Normal Form through a series of well-defined transformations. Each step preserves the language while gradually restructuring the grammar to comply with CNF requirements. The resulting grammar, though more complex in structure, generates exactly the same language as the original.

The code is modular, with each transformation step encapsulated in its own method, making it easy to understand and maintain. Additionally, the implementation is flexible enough to handle any valid context-free grammar, not just the specific variant from the assignment.

This laboratory work provided valuable insights into formal language theory and the importance of standardized grammar representations in computational linguistics and compiler design. The Chomsky Normal Form, despite adding complexity to the grammar structure, simplifies parsing algorithms and serves as a fundamental tool in language processing.
